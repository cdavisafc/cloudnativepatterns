# Code to accompany Cloud Native Patterns by Cornelia Davis

Welcome to Cloud Native Patterns 2.0!

Book is sold at your favorite booksellers ([Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-patterns),[Amazon](https://a.co/d/hXOjtJ3))

That is to say, I have not fully committed to a second edition, but am seriously toying with the idea. All of the patterns that I cover in the book are as relevant today as they were when I originally published in 2019, but there have been advancements in platforms and frameworks. As I always say, as a developer/architect, you need to understand all of these patterns, but you often won't have to implement them yourself - that comes from said platforms and frameworks! Keep an eye here to see the coding examples updated to take advantage of the latest/greatest!

I'm not yet sure how much detail I'll put in the READMEs since the original repo was designed as a companion to the book, but I will capture instructions that differ from that in the book.
